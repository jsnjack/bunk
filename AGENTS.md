## Overview

bunk is a lightweight terminal multiplexer written in Go. Each pane is a real
PTY-backed shell; the screen is divided using a BSP tree; tcell handles host
terminal I/O. It is used daily with Copilot CLI, Claude Code, btop, vim, and
other TUI apps.

```

Key local extensions to vendored vt10x:
- SGR 2/8/9/21/53/58 and 4:N underline styles
- `Cursor.Shape` (DECSCUSR)
- `ModeSetPaste` (DECSET 2004), `ModeSync` (DECSET 2026)
- `QueryPrivateMode(n)` — returns DECRQM status byte for any tracked private mode
- Private-parameter SGR guard (`\x1b[?4m` no longer misfires as SGR 4)
- Display-cell widths and wide-glyph continuations; `ReplaceScreen` preserves
  terminal modes, attributes, callbacks, and hyperlink identities during reflow
- DEC 12 cursor blink; DEC 2027 grapheme widths (enabled by default).
  `Glyph.Combining` stores an immutable grapheme suffix, bounded to 1 KiB/cell.
- DECRQSS reports SGR, scroll margins, and cursor style; unsupported settings
  return a negative response. Unknown DECRQM modes return status 0, not 4.

## Key Flows

1. **Startup** — `main()` → `Execute()` → `run()` loads config, initialises
   slog, queries cell aspect, probes host OSC colours, initialises tcell,
   spawns the first `Pane` and enters `App.eventLoop()`.
2. **Pane I/O** — three goroutines per pane: `readPTY` (PTY → vt10x →
   redraw), `waitForExit`, `trackFgProcess`. One shared `renderLoop` drains
   `app.redraw` (buffered 1).
3. **Resize / reflow** — `App.handleResize()` coalesces host resizes and
   updates the BSP tree. Emulator reflow finishes before the PTY receives its
   new size and SIGWINCH; both are deferred together during resize bursts.
   `Pane.resizeAndReflow()` replays `rawBuf` into a
   scratch grid, then replaces the live grid without resetting terminal state.
4. **OSC passthrough** — bounded `ptyStream` framing precedes `osc.go` scanning.
   OSC 7/52/133 reach the host through `app.oscBuf`; OSC 8 links are stored on
   glyphs and emitted with their rendered text.

**Lock ordering:** always `app.mu` before `Pane.mu`. Never acquire `app.mu`
while holding `Pane.mu`.

## Build & Run

```bash
make check    # full validation gate (fmt → vet → race tests → build → lint)
make test     # tests only (race-enabled)
make build    # cross-compiles bin/bunk_{linux,darwin}_{amd64,arm64}
make run      # builds local binary and opens a debug session with --trace
```

Tests run with `-race` and are required to pass before any binary is built.
`make test` includes the locally patched tcell module and its terminfo tests.
The gate is serialized even with `make -j`; the project-specific test-before-
build rule takes precedence over the generic gate ordering.

Manual regression scripts (run for changes that touch the listed areas):
- `bash terminal_features.sh text` — SGR/style changes in `render.go` or `internal/vt10x/state.go`
- `bash terminal_features.sh colors` — ANSI/256/RGB/underline-colour changes
- `TERMINAL_FEATURES_AUTO=1 bash terminal_features.sh cursor` — cursor-shape, width, emoji, reflow
- `TERMINAL_FEATURES_AUTO=1 bash terminal_features.sh integration` — hyperlink, bracketed-paste, OSC 133
- `bash terminal_features.sh queries` + `bash terminal_features.sh osc` — OSC, DECRQM, capability queries, kitty-keyboard
- `TERMINAL_FEATURES_AUTO=1 bash terminal_features.sh graphics` — image decoding, clipping, resize, scrollback

---

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/bunk/config.toml` (override with `--config`). Generate
a documented default with `bunk config init`.
Malformed/unreadable files and missing explicit `--config` paths fail at startup;
a missing default file uses built-in defaults.

Key fields agents may need to know about:
- `theme` — built-in name (`terminal`, `default`, `solarized-dark`, `dracula`, `nord`) or custom palette
- `scrollback` — per-pane scrollback line cap (default 10 000)
- `log_file` — destination for `--debug` / `--trace` output (default `/tmp/bunk.log`)
- `cell_aspect` — fallback height/width ratio when the host terminal doesn't answer the pixel-size query
- `[keybindings]` — overrides for split / zoom / quit / search / copy / paste
- `[ui]` — hex colour overrides for borders and scrollbar

`config.go` is the authoritative reference for every field and its default.

## Design Decisions

- **Keyboard passthrough is per pane.** Ctrl+F12 (`[keys].passthrough`) toggles
  forwarding of all other keys through the normal terminal encoder. The toggle
  remains reserved and exits bunk search. Mouse handling is unchanged. The PASS
  badge shares the status layout, takes highest priority, and invalidates the
  render overlay when toggled.

- **PTY is one column narrower than the pane.** The rightmost column
  (`p.x + p.w - 1`) is reserved for the scrollbar; the PTY never writes there.
- **Cursor shape and cell content must be read under the same lock.** Both
  live inside `p.term`; `render()` must read them within the same `p.mu`
  acquisition so `readPTY` can't sneak in a write between the two. Guarded by
  `TestReadPTYSingleLock_ClaudeCursorRace`.
- **vt10x coordinates are display cells.** Wide characters occupy a lead cell
  (`Glyph.Width == 2`) and a continuation (`-1`); `-2` marks padding before a
  wide-character wrap. Rendering, search, and selection skip continuations.
  Combining marks, variation selectors, and multi-codepoint emoji stay together
  in the lead cell through render, copy, search, and reflow. Mode 2027 can switch
  back to per-codepoint widths for legacy applications.
- **Query replies belong to the pane.** They are generated in stream order in
  both primary and alternate screens, including SSH/mosh panes; they are never
  delegated to the outer terminal. Unknown host colour defaults remain unknown.
  XTGETTCAP key replies use the normal input encoder with the current pane modes
  and Kitty flags; its terminal-name reply matches the TERM exported to panes.
- **Graphics are ordinary cells.** Static SIXEL, Kitty, and iTerm2 images become
  half-block glyphs with immutable `Glyph.Image` samples. They clip, erase, scroll,
  and reflow with the grid; source bitmaps are not retained by scrollback. No image
  escape is forwarded to the host. Kitty file/shared-memory access is rejected.
  PTYs and CSI 14/16/18 replies use virtual pixels (8 wide, height from cell aspect).
  Transfers are capped at 8 MiB, decoded images at 4 million pixels / 4096 per
  axis, and Kitty caches at 32 MiB / 32 images. Graphics-bearing raw history gets
  a 16 MiB minimum budget and is never trimmed inside a control sequence.
- **Cursor colour follows the active pane.** OSC 12 overrides and OSC 112 resets
  are emitted through tcell; shutdown restores the host cursor colour.
- **Synchronized updates are per pane.** Other panes continue repainting;
  an abandoned update is released after one second.
- **Kitty keyboard state belongs to its negotiating foreground process group.**
  Polling clears it only after that owner leaves the foreground.
- **Terminal cleanup runs synchronously in `main` after the event loop.**
  Background goroutines can't be relied on to finish their cleanup before
  the process exits.
- **Nested sessions are refused.** `BUNK=1` is exported into every pane's
  environment; the binary exits at startup if it sees it set.

---

## Gotchas

- TUI owns stderr — do not write logs there. All diagnostic output goes
  through `slog` to the trace file (`/tmp/bunk.log`). Errors that the user
  needs to see surface through the UI.
- Vendored vt10x has local patches. Prefer fixing bugs there over working
  around them in the main code.
- `TERMINAL_AUDIT.md` is the authoritative reference for which terminal
  features are implemented, partial, or missing. When investigating a
  rendering or input bug, consult it first; when fixing a feature, update it
  to reflect the new status.

## Test recipes

**Minimal Pane (no PTY):**
```go
term := vt10x.New(vt10x.WithSize(cols, rows))
p := &Pane{
    term:            term,
    cmd:             &exec.Cmd{},  // non-nil prevents cwd() nil-deref in emitTitle
    x: 0, y: 0, w: cols, h: rows,
    scrollbackLines: 100,
    sb:              sbRing{maxLines: 100},
}
```

**Simulation screen:**
```go
scr := tcell.NewSimulationScreen("UTF-8")
scr.Init()
defer scr.Fini()
scr.SetSize(w, h)
// scr.GetContent(x, y) → (mainc rune, combc []rune, style, width)
```

**Minimal App for calling render():**
```go
app := &App{
    screen: scr,
    root:   &Node{pane: p},
    active: p,
    oscBuf: newOSCBuffer(),
    theme:  testTheme(),
}
```
